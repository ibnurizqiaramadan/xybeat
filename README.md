## Troubleshooting

### Music Player Issues

If you encounter issues with the music player:

#### Common Solutions

1. **Check system dependencies**:
   \`\`\`bash

   # Verify yt-dlp is installed and accessible

   /snap/bin/yt-dlp --version

   # Verify FFmpeg is installed

   /usr/bin/ffmpeg -version
   \`\`\`

2. **Check voice permissions**: Ensure bot has Connect and Speak permissions in voice channels

3. **Verify file permissions**: Ensure bot can write to \`~/music-bot/mp3/\` directory
   \`\`\`bash
   mkdir -p ~/music-bot/mp3
   chmod 755 ~/music-bot/mp3
   \`\`\`

4. **Check bot logs**: Look for specific error messages in console output

#### Playlist Issues

- **Private playlists**: Bot will extract single video if playlist is private
- **Large playlists**: Limited to 50 videos to prevent spam
- **Mixed URLs**: Bot automatically handles video URLs with playlist parameters

#### Audio Quality Issues

- **Format 18**: Used for optimal quality/compatibility balance
- **MP3 conversion**: All audio standardized to MP3 format
- **Local caching**: Files stored locally for faster subsequent access

For detailed troubleshooting history, see \`YTDL_FIX.md\` and \`DAVE_FIX.md\`.

## 🆕 What's New

### Latest Updates

- ✅ **Native yt-dlp Integration** - Replaced play-dl with direct yt-dlp binary calls
- ✅ **YouTube Playlist Support** - Full playlist extraction and queueing
- ✅ **Paginated Queue System** - Interactive navigation with buttons
- ✅ **MP3 File Caching** - Local storage for faster replay
- ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling** - Graceful fallbacks for private/unavailable content
- ✅ **Format Optimization** - Uses format 18 with FFmpeg conversion for best compatibility
- ✅ **Discord.js v14 Compatibility** - Fixed all deprecation warnings

### Technical Architecture

The bot now uses a hybrid approach:

1. **yt-dlp** for metadata extraction and video downloading
2. **FFmpeg** for audio format conversion (format 18 → MP3)
3. **Local file system** for caching downloaded audio
4. **Discord.js voice** for audio playback from cached files

This provides maximum reliability, faster subsequent playback, and better format compatibility.
