2. Export a command object with `data` and `execute` properties
3. Run `npm run deploy-commands` to register the new command
4. Restart the bot

### Adding New Events

1. Create a new file in `src/events/` following the existing pattern
2. Export an event object with `name`, `execute`, and optionally `once` properties
3. Restart the bot to load the new event

## Bot Permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Connection Issues

#### "Used disallowed intents" Error

If you get this error, check your Discord Developer Portal settings:

1. **Go to Discord Developer Portal** → Your Application → Bot
2. **Check "Privileged Gateway Intents"** section:
   - ❌ **DO NOT enable** "Presence Intent" (not needed)
   - ❌ **DO NOT enable** "Server Members Intent" (not needed) 
   - ❌ **DO NOT enable** "Message Content Intent" (not needed for slash commands)
3. **XyBeat only needs basic intents** which are enabled by default
4. **If error persists**, the bot token might be invalid or expired

#### Permission Issues

Ensure your bot has these permissions in Discord servers:
- **Send Messages** - For command responses
- **Use Slash Commands** - For command execution  
- **Connect** - To join voice channels
- **Speak** - To play audio in voice channels
- **View Channels** - To see voice and text channels

### Adding Invite Button to Bot Profile

To add a clickable invite button on your bot's Discord profile:

1. **Go to Discord Developer Portal** → Your Application → General Information
2. **Scroll down to "Install Link" section**
3. **Set the install link to:**
   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_BOT_ID&permissions=2184301632&scope=bot%20applications.commands
   ```
4. **Replace `YOUR_BOT_ID`** with your actual bot's client ID
5. **Save changes**

This will add an "Invite [BotName]" button on your bot's profile that users can click to invite the bot to their servers.

### Music Player Issues

If you encounter issues with the music player:

#### Common Solutions

1. **Check system dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Verify yt-dlp is installed and accessible
   /snap/bin/yt-dlp --version

   # Verify FFmpeg is installed
   /usr/bin/ffmpeg -version
   ```

2. **Check voice permissions**: Ensure bot has Connect and Speak permissions in voice channels

3. **Verify file permissions**: Ensure bot can write to `~/music-bot/mp3/` directory
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/music-bot/mp3
   chmod 755 ~/music-bot/mp3
   ```

4. **Check bot logs**: Look for specific error messages in console output

#### Playlist Issues

- **Private playlists**: Bot will extract single video if playlist is private
- **Large playlists**: Limited to 50 videos to prevent spam
- **Mixed URLs**: Bot automatically handles video URLs with playlist parameters

#### Audio Quality Issues

- **Format 18**: Used for optimal quality/compatibility balance
- **MP3 conversion**: All audio standardized to MP3 format
- **Local caching**: Files stored locally for faster subsequent access
